The sun is the initial source of energy, which provides energy for everything on the planet.
The Sun is the very beginning of our food chain.
The Sun provides the energy for plants to undergo photosynthesis, which begins the food chain.
Producers in a food chain or food web take the sun's light and convert it into food through photosynthesis.
This group composes the largest group of organisms on Earth. Sugar results from photosynthesis,
wherein plants or algae take sunlight, carbon dioxide and water and produce food (sugar) and oxygen.
Effectively, the sun's energy triggers the beginning of the energy transfer in the food web.

The producers in a food chain include all autotrophs such as phytoplankton, cyanobacteria, algae, and green plants.
This is the first stage in a food chain.
The producers make up the first level of a food chain.
The producers utilise the energy from the sun to make food.
Producers are also known as autotrophs as they make their own food.
Producers are any plant or other organisms that produce their own nutrients through photosynthesis.

<h1>Consumers<a name="g3"></a></h1>

<p>Consumers are all organisms that are dependent on plants or other organisms for food.
This is the largest part of a food web, as it contains almost all living organisms.
It includes herbivores which are animals that eat plants, carnivores which are animals that eat other animals,
parasites that live on other organisms by harming them and lastly the scavengers, which are animals that eat dead animals’ carcasses.
